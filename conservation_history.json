The power supply should be 230V 50Hz, with a socket load capacity of 10A or more.\\n\\n**Important Considerations (from the document):**\\n\\n*   **Avoid Direct Sunlight and Heat Sources:** Do not place the embedding system under direct sunlight or near a heat source.\\n*   **Avoid Humidity:** Avoid excessive air humidity.\\n*   **Avoid Electrical Interference:** Do not place the system in areas with electrical interference (such as near refrigerators, ultrasonic cleaners, microwave ovens, centrifuges).' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': []} id='run-99e06b13-d293-49d7-8086-12487375a845-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2568, 'output_tokens': 252, 'total_tokens': 2820, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}",
